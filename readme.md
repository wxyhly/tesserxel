### A WebGPU based 4D scene render engine

Tesserxel is a project aimed for providing 4D scenes rendering and interacting library on web. This project uses experimental WebGPU API. 

### Introduction to fourth spatial dimension
Here "4D space" is not "spacetime" in physics! If you count time, our journey with tesserxel is in 5d spacetime world.
If you are confused with the concept of 4D, try to look at these websites:

### Examples

Attention: Examples should be open by a WebGPU supported browser (e.g. Google Chrome Canary), and experimental WebGPU should be enabled in the browser's settings.
