### An Engine All About 4D World: Modeling, Rendering, Physics...

Tesserxel is a project aimed for providing 4D scenes rendering and interacting library on web. This project uses experimental WebGPU API to provide a WebGPU based 4D render engine.

### Examples
- [Online example browser](https://wxyhly.github.io/tesserxel/examples/)

![scree snapshots in example browser](https://wxyhly.github.io/img/tsx001.jpg)
Attention: Examples should be opened by a WebGPU supported browser (e.g. Google Chrome Canary), and experimental WebGPU should be enabled in the browser's settings.

#### Appendix: Introduction to fourth spatial dimension
Here "4D space" is not "spacetime" in physics! If you count time, our journey with tesserxel is in 5d spacetime world.
